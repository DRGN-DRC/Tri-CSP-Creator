## Usage
This program can be used with the GUI, or by command line. When used via command line, it can be used in two different ways; either with a config file, or without. When running without providing a config file, size and position arguments for each image will need to be provided. In other words, the program has these three run modes:

    gui                 Run this program using a GUI, which can accept
                        optional arguments for image filepaths to pre-populate
                        those inputs. (default, if run without arguments)

    cmd                 Run this program via command line only, in which case
                        image paths and most other arguments are required. Run
                        "Tri-CSP-Creator.py cmd -h" to see a list of all
                        arguments.

    cmd-config          Run this program via command line only, using image
                        filepaths and one configuration filepath as arguments.


You can run `"Tri-CSP Creator.exe" cmd -h` to see all arguments.
